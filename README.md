# antlr-odata [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/cam-m/antlr-odata.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/cam-m/antlr-odata)
## Lite Grammar
The OData Lite grammar is a work in progress. It only supports the features of OData that I (the author) has 
found personally useful. E.g. 
 - Resource based queries and their respective query options (expand, select, top, filter, count, etc...)

## Full Grammar
The full odata 4.0 Antlr grammar from here:

https://tools.oasis-open.org/version-control/browse/wsvn/odata/trunk/4.01%20spec/grammar/ANTLR/ODataLexer.g4

...has been copied to this project, however it will need refactoring to be of practical use. In its current state
it will not build.
